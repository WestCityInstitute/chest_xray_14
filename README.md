This repo contains the splits of train, valid and test used in the the paper: 

[Learning to diagnose from scratch by exploiting dependencies among labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10501)

Note 1: As the split was done by image, and each patient could have multiple images, there are significant overlap in patient across train, valid, and across train, test. 

Note 2: At the time of this publication, no official splits existed. Please be aware that the official splits are now available [here](https://nihcc.app.box.com/v/ChestXray-NIHCC). The official split is by patient other than by image. This is a much harder a split than ours.
